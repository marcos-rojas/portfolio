# Portfolio
This is the first attemp to make a portfolio as I think it would look like. I really love minimalist design because they are brief and clear when someone point to. This
doesn't mean it's easy or that complex websites are not good enough (I've seen great examples with parallax animations and works that are delighful to see). Currently, I'm
looking for a position as Data Analyst because it mix my passion and my improvement opportunities: as someone from engineering, I really get into technology and
learning new tool are quite easy for me but social skills are a challenge that I always enjoy because all I've read and all I would love to share.
